/**
 * A list of volume bindings for this container. Each volume binding
 * is a string in one of these forms:
 *
 * - `host-src:container-dest[:options]` to bind-mount a host path
 * into the container. Both `host-src`, and `container-dest` must
 * be an _absolute_ path.
 * - `volume-name:container-dest[:options]` to bind-mount a volume
 * managed by a volume driver into the container. `container-dest`
 * must be an _absolute_ path.
 *
 * `options` is an optional, comma-delimited list of:
 *
 * - `nocopy` disables automatic copying of data from the container
 * path to the volume. The `nocopy` flag only applies to named volumes.
 * - `[ro|rw]` mounts a volume read-only or read-write, respectively.
 * If omitted or set to `rw`, volumes are mounted read-write.
 * - `[z|Z]` applies SELinux labels to allow or deny multiple containers
 * to read and write to the same volume.
 * - `z`: a _shared_ content label is applied to the content. This
 * label indicates that multiple containers can share the volume
 * content, for both reading and writing.
 * - `Z`: a _private unshared_ label is applied to the content.
 * This label indicates that only the current container can use
 * a private volume. Labeling systems such as SELinux require
 * proper labels to be placed on volume content that is mounted
 * into a container. Without a label, the security system can
 * prevent a container's processes from using the content. By
 * default, the labels set by the host operating system are not
 * modified.
 * - `[[r]shared|[r]slave|[r]private]` specifies mount
 * [propagation behavior](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt).
 * This only applies to bind-mounted volumes, not internal volumes
 * or named volumes. Mount propagation requires the source mount
 * point (the location where the source directory is mounted in the
 * host operating system) to have the correct propagation properties.
 * For shared volumes, the source mount point must be set to `shared`.
 * For slave volumes, the mount must be set to either `shared` or
 * `slave`.
