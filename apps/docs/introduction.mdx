## Introduction

Welcome to EvalX, a powerful service that allows users to run code in various languages and runtimes through a simple HTTP request to our /eval endpoint. 

Whether you're a developer, researcher, or hobbyist, EvalX provides a convenient and secure platform to execute your code snippets, scripts, and applications in real-time, without the need to set up and maintain complex development environments.

With EvalX, you can write and execute code in popular programming languages such as JavaScript and Python, as well as many more languages and runtimes that we plan to add in the future. Our service is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to choose the programming language and runtime that best suits their needs.

## Security

At EvalX, we take security seriously. We use advanced sandboxing techniques to ensure that user code runs in a safe and secure environment, preventing any malicious or harmful code from causing damage to our system or other users. Additionally, we provide a simple yet powerful authentication and authorization system to protect your data and code snippets.

If you find any security vulnerabilities in our system, please report them to us immediately at security@evalx.sh so that we can fix them as soon as possible. We appreciate your help in making EvalX a safe and secure platform for everyone to use.
